This Privacy Policy explains how the PigPig Discord Bot (the "Application") collects, uses, and protects your personal information when you use its features. This policy should be read in conjunction with Discord's Privacy Policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

The Application collects the following types of data to provide its core functionality:

* **Discord Interaction Data:** This includes the content of your conversations with the Application in servers and direct messages, your User ID, Server ID, Channel ID, and message timestamps.
* **Long-Term Conversation Memory Data:** The Application uses its "Memory System" to **permanently store** and intelligently retrieve conversation history via semantic search, to provide enhanced conversational context and memory features.
* **Multimedia Content:** **Image content** you upload for Visual Question Answering (VQA) and AI image generation/editing.
* **User Preference Data:**
    * User ratings and feedback collected via the "Eat" (Restaurant Recommendation) function to learn server-specific culinary preferences.
    * **User-specific data** manually updated or intelligently merged by the AI through the "User Data" system.
* **Bot Configuration Data:** Includes Bot Owner ID, bug report channel ID, custom system prompt settings, and other configuration parameters necessary for bot operation.

## 2. How We Use the Information

We collect your data solely for the following purposes:

* To provide **AI-driven conversations** and **multi-modal capabilities** (VQA, Image Generation) as core features.
* To build the **Intelligent Channel Memory** allowing the bot to recall conversations and maintain context over time.
* To manage **Music Playback** queues and playlists.
* To offer personalized services, such as **Restaurant Recommendations** based on historical ratings.
* To process internal system error reports and manage the automated update process.
* To manage the bot's personality and behavior based on "System Prompt Manager" configurations.

## 3. Data Sharing and Storage (Third-Party Services)

As the Application is driven by multiple Large Language Models (LLMs), your interaction data will be shared with third-party service providers:

* **Third-Party LLM Services:** To provide AI responses and multi-modal functions, your **conversation content, image content, and interaction data** will be transmitted to the following **Third-Party API Services** for processing: Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI (GPT), and Google (Gemini).
    * **Please Note:** These services have their own independent Terms of Service and Privacy Policies, which you should review.
* **Data Location:** (Insert your server/database hosting location here, e.g., Data is stored on a Virtual Private Server located in [Insert Country/Region].)

## 4. Data Retention and Your Rights

* **Long-Term Memory:** Your long-term conversation memory data is **retained indefinitely** until actively deleted by you or a server administrator using bot commands, or until the Application is removed from the server.
* **Data Access and Deletion:** You have the right to request access to, correction of, or deletion of personal data stored by the Application that is related to you.
* **Request Method:** Please contact us using the "Contact Information" provided below to submit a request.
